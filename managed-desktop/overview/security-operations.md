The Microsoft Managed Desktop Security Operations Center (SOC) partners with your information security staff to keep your desktop environment secure. Our team receives and responds to all security alerts on managed devices with expert analysis. When needed, we drive security incident response activities. For more information about working with the SOC, review operational documentation in your Admin portal.

The SOC offers 24/7/365 coverage from Microsoft full-time employees with expertise in the current and emerging threat landscape, including common attack methods through software, network, or human adversaries.
