# Microsoft Managed Desktop support teams

There are two Microsoft Managed Desktop teams to support your organization.

## Service Engineering team

The Service Engineering (“operations”) team operates the Microsoft Managed Desktop service including responding to [support requests](../operate/support-request.md) such as:

- Incidents
- Requests for information
- Change requests

For a general description of the service, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop service plan description](../overview/service-plan.md#service-plan-description).

For information, see [standard operating procedures](../overview/standard-operating-procedures.md).

## Security Operations Center team

Our Security Operations Center (SOC) team protects Microsoft Managed Desktop devices including monitoring security threats, responding to security alerts, and managing security incidents.  

For more information, see [security technologies](../overview/security-technologies.md) to learn about the technologies we use to secure the services. [Security operations](../overview/security-operations.md) describes the security-related processes we use.
