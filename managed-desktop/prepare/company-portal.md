# Install the Intune Company Portal on devices

Microsoft Managed Desktop requires the Intune Company Portal on Microsoft Managed Desktop enrolled devices. If the app hasnâ€™t been added to your tenant, Microsoft Managed Desktop will add the app to your tenant during enrollment.  

The benefits to your organization include:

- One place to browse and install available applications.
- IT administrators can organize applications by categories for their users.
- Deploy apps like [Microsoft Project and Microsoft Visio](../operate/project-visio.md) with Microsoft Managed Desktop.
