# Enroll your tenant

> [!NOTE]
> You must be logged in as a Global Administrator to complete enrollment. For more information, see [access the admin center](../prepare/access-admin-center.md) for details.

Once your tenant has been enabled for enrollment, open [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) and navigate to **Tenant Administration**. In the **Microsoft Managed Desktop** section, select **Tenant enrollment**. Then, follow the prompts to enroll your tenant with Microsoft Managed Desktop.
