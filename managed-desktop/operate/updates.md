# How updates are handled in Microsoft Managed Desktop

<!--This topic is the target for a "Learn more" link in the admin center (aka.ms/update-rings); do not delete.-->

<!--Update management -->

Microsoft Managed Desktop connects all devices to a modern cloud-based infrastructure.

Keeping Windows, Office, drivers, firmware, and Microsoft Store for Business applications up to date is a balance of speed and stability. We use update groups to ensure operating system updates and policies are rolled out in a safe manner. For more information, see the video [Microsoft Managed Desktop Change and Release Process](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4mWqP).

Updates released by Microsoft are cumulative and are categorized as quality or feature updates. For more information, see [Windows Update for Business: Update types](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb#update-types).

## Update groups

Microsoft Managed Desktop uses four Azure AD groups to manage updates:

| Group | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Test | Used to validate Microsoft Managed Desktop policy changes, operating system updates, feature updates, and other changes pushed to the Azure AD organization ("tenant"). The Test group is: <br><ul><li>Best for testing or users who can provide early feedback.</li><li>Exempt from any established service level agreements and user support.</li><li>Available to validate compatibility of applications with new policy or operating system changes.</li></ul> |
| First | Contains early software adopters and devices that could be subject to pre-release updates. <br><br> Devices in this group might experience outages if there are scenarios that weren't covered during testing in the test ring. |
| Fast | Prioritizes speed over stability. The Fast group is: <br><ul><li>Useful for detecting quality issues before they're offered to the Broad group.</li> <li>The next layer of validation, and is typically more stable than the Test and First groups.</li></ul> |
| Broad | This group is the last group to have feature and quality updates available. <br><br> The Broad group contains most of users in the Azure AD organization, and therefore favors stability over speed in deployment. Testing of apps should be done with this group because the environment is the most stable. |

### Moving devices between update groups

You might want some devices to receive updates last and others that you want to go first. To move these devices into the appropriate update group, see [Assign devices to a deployment group](../operate/assign-deployment-group.md).

For more information on roles and responsibilities within these deployment groups, see [Microsoft Managed Desktop Roles and responsibilities](../overview/roles-and-responsibilities.md)

### Using Microsoft Managed Desktop update groups

There are parts of the service that you manage, like app deployment, where it might be necessary to target all managed devices.

## Update deployment

Below describes how update deployment works.

| Step | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Step 1 | Microsoft Managed Desktop deploys a new feature or quality update according to the schedule specified in the following table.|
| Step 2 | During deployment, Microsoft Managed Desktop monitors for signs of failure, or disruption based on diagnostic data and the user support system. If any are detected, we immediately pause the deployment to all current and future groups.<br><br> For example, if an issue is discovered while deploying a quality update to the First group, then update deployments to First, Fast, and Broad groups will be paused until the issue is mitigated. <br><br> You can report compatibility issues by filing a ticket in the Microsoft Managed Desktop admin center. <br><br> Feature and quality updates are paused independently. The pause is in effect for 35 days by default. However, it can be reduced or extended depending on whether the issue is mitigated. |
| Step 3 | Once the groups are unpaused, deployment resumes according to the schedule in the table. |
| Step 4| Users are empowered to respond to restart notifications for a set period. This period is known as the deadline, and it's measured from the time the update is offered to the device. <br><br> During this time, the device will only automatically restart outside active hours. After this period expires, the deadline has been reached and the device will restart at the next available opportunity, regardless of active hours. <br><br> The deadline for quality updates is three days; for feature updates it's five days. |

> [!NOTE]
> This deployment process applies to both feature and quality updates, though the timeline varies for each.

## Deployment settings

>[!NOTE]
>These deferral periods are intentionally designed to ensure high security and performance standards for all users.<br><br> Based on data gathered across all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and the varying scope and impact of updates, Microsoft Managed Desktop reserves flexibility to modify the length of the above deferral periods for any and all deployment groups on an ad hoc basis.
>
>Microsoft Managed Desktop conducts an independent assessment of each Windows feature release to evaluate its necessity and usefulness to its managed tenants. Consequently, Microsoft Managed Desktop might or might not deploy all Windows feature updates.

## Windows Insider Program

Microsoft Managed Desktop doesn't support devices that are part of the Windows Insider program.

The Windows Insider program is used to validate pre-release Windows software. It's intended for devices that aren't mission critical. While it's an important Microsoft initiative, it's not intended for broad deployment in production environments.

Any devices found with Windows Insider builds might be put into the Test group. These devices will be exempt from update service level agreements and user support from Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## Bandwidth management

We use [Delivery Optimization](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization) for all operating system and driver updates. Delivery Optimization minimizes the download size from the Windows Update service by seeking updates from peers within the corporate network.
