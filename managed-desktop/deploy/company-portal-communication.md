# Assign the Company Portal and communicate changes to your users

## Assign the Company Portal to your users

Following your enrollment in Microsoft Managed Desktop, you should deploy the Company Portal app to the Microsoft Managed Desktop users or devices in your organization.

## Communicate change to your users

As the IT administrator for your organization, it's important to let your users know how to use Company Portal in your organization. Microsoft Managed Desktop recommends:

- Steps on installing applications from the Company Portal. For more information, see [Install and share apps on your device](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows).
- How to send requests to IT administrators for applications that aren't currently available. For more information, see [Request an app for work or school](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows#request-an-app-for-work-or-school).
