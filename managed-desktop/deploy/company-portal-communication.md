# Configure the Intune Company Portal app

Following your enrollment in Microsoft Managed Desktop, the service will add the Intune Company Portal, if not already, to your tenant and assign it to each of the serviceâ€™s [deployment rings](../operate/updates.md#microsoft-managed-desktop-deployment-rings).  

IT administrators can customize Company Portal for their organization. Customizations includes brand imaging, adding in local support contacts, and more. For more information, see [How to Configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](/intune/company-portal-app).

## Communicate change to your users

As the IT administrator for your organization, it's important to let your users know how to use Company Portal in your organization. Microsoft Managed Desktop recommends:

- Steps on installing applications from the Company Portal. For more information, see [Install and share apps on your device](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows).
- How to send requests to IT administrators for applications that aren't currently available. For more information, see [Request an app for work or school](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows#request-an-app-for-work-or-school).
